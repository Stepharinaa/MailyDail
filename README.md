# Article Sharing Platform

## Deployed Version:

You can view the live version of the app here:
https://mailydail.netlify.app/

## Description:

Inspired by Reddit/BBC News, this project is a web application that allows users to browse articles on a variety of topics, read articles, comment on them, and vote for their favorite ones!

It features a clean, modern interface with flexible sorting and filtering options for articles, and provides user interaction through comments and votes.

The application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. It utilises React for the frontend and communicates with a RESTful API for retrieving and posting data.

## Features:

- Browse articles by different topics (including filter functionality).

- Sort articles based on date or votes.

- Read articles and see detailed content.

- Vote on articles to increase their popularity.

- Comment on articles to engage with other users.

- Remove their own comment(s).

## How to Use:

1. Visit the deployed version of the app linked above.

2. Explore the list of articles.

3. Click on any article to read the full content and see related comments.

4. Sort articles or filter them by topic to find what interests you.

5. Vote and comment to interact with the content (_currently, users are hardcoded to have username of grumpy19. I am planning to add some form of authentication in the near future_).

6. Delete comment(s) as you see fit.
